## EuchrePal

Welcome to EuchrePal, a simple companion app for your Euchre games.

How many times have you asked the other players: "What's trump?" Now you can keep track of the current trump suit simply by tapping a button on your phone. If you forget what trump is, just glance at the screen. We suggest passing the phone to the caller every round of the game. That way, you'll always know who called trump.

The app can also display the card hierarchy to remind new players which are the right and left bowers.

Let us know what you think of the app -- and have fun playing Euchre!
